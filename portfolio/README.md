Stephanie Oh | Portfolio Website

**Live site:** [https://stephanie-oh.com](https://stephanie-oh.com)
This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my work in **cybersecurity, application security, and cloud computing**. It highlights my technical projects, leadership experiences, and offers insights into my approach to building secure, scalable systems.

## About the project
This website serves as a hub to:
- Present selected projects that explore secure network protocols, concurrency, and web application design.
- Share insights on my view on topics like AppSec and cloud infrastructure.
- Provide an overview of my leadership, global volunteer work, and creative interests that shape my approach to technology.

## Built with
- **Next.js (React + TypeScript)**: Enables component based architecture, server side rendering, and optimized routing.
- **Vercel**: For seamless CI/CD deployment, every push to GitHub triggers a production build.
- **Responsive CSS**: Ensures the site looks great across desktop and mobile.

## Key highlights
- Developed a modular structure using Next.js pages and reusable components.
- Integrated professional routing, clean layouts, and SEO friendly metadata.
- Wrote reflections exploring AppSec and cloud security concepts, tying them back to hands on work.
- Automated deployment via GitHub -> Vercel pipeline for zero downtime updates.

## Notable projects featured
This portfolio links to and documents several hands on technical projects, including:
- **Distance Vector Routing Algorithm (Python):** Simulated using Bellman Ford for secure, efficient network path discovery.
- **Fork based Password Cracker (C):** Parallel brute force demonstrating Unix process management and secure hashing lessons.
- **Multi threaded Ticket Booking System (C):** Explored mutex locks for concurrency and data consistency.
- **Chatroom with TCP/UDP (Python):** Showcased secure socket programming and concurrent client management.

All projects are available in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/soh2970).
